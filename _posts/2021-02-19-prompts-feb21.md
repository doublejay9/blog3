Sounds like most of the US is having some crazy winter weather. Here in my neck of the woods, we've had plenty of snow the past two weeks. I've gathered some writing prompts to keep you company. Best enjoyed warm.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Write a story where the main character's jealousy ends up saving their beloved.

2. Write about a cold case that's solved by an army of amateur sleuths.

3. The main character finds a hidden weapon stash. Who hid them? Why? Does the main character get dragged into a conflict they didn't sign up for?

4. Write a story from the perspective of a letter-carrier.

5. Write a story set in a lightning farm -- a field filled with lightning rods used to gather electricity from thunderstorms.

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
