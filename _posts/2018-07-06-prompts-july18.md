Enjoyed any fireworks recently? I have. Here are some more prompts to keep your summer writing rolling.

<!--excerpt-->

1. A mysterious illness breaks out in the country that the main character is visiting. Now they're stuck there because of the quarantine. Does the main character catch the mystery illness too? Are they roped into the relief effort?

2. The main character has been living a double life. What forces them to end the charade? What are the consequences for telling the truth?

3. A detective and their partner go to meet an informant. The situation feels sketchy, at least to the partner, but the detective isn't fazed. Why?

4. A normally level-headed character snaps. What triggers their emotional outburst?

5. Write a story that takes place in a casino.
