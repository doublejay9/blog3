I don't care what anybody says. It's too hot to wish people a happy fall. (Though I'm sure my Southern Hemisphere readers are more than ready for spring to arrive.)

Seasonal rant aside, here are some prompts to help kickstart September's writing.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Write about how one civilian's mistake sparks a war.

2. You often hear people call an organization or government rotten. What if that was literally true? What's rotting in the CEO's office or the halls of Parliament? How long can people keep it secret before the stench becomes overpowering?

3. Write about an invasion from a different reality -- aliens from another galaxy, monsters from another dimension, an army from the past or future. Do the main character find the place where the invaders are coming from? Can they steal the portal?

4. Say "escort mission" to any gamer, and they'll regale you with stories of frustrating episodes where they had to protect an effectively useless NPC as wave after wave of enemies inevitably attacked them. Write about a similar scenario -- a strong character guiding and protecting a far weaker one on the dangerous road from A to B. For bonus points, write from the perspective of the weaker character.

5. Write about how one civilian's mistake sparks a war.
