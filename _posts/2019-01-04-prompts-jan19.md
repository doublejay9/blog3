New year, new writing goals, and a new batch of prompts to kickstart both. Enjoy!

<!--excerpt-->

1. A star actor is living the good life. Then a nobody catches the public's eye, quickly dethroning our main character. How far does the rivalry between these two actors go?

2. All children crave attention. But one quiet kid goes to extreme lengths to get it. What are these extreme lengths? What price must they pay?

3. An eccentric aristocrat has a fascination with doors. They want doors installed all over their mansion, including many that lead to nowhere. Write about the poor construction crew who's trying to please their client's odd requests.

4. Write about a revolution that fails. How does the government reassert its power? Are the rebels executed as traitors or are they dealt with in other ways?

5. A border fort is attacked at night. How do the soldiers fend off the would-be invaders?
