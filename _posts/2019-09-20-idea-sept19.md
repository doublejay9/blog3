title: Idea You Can Steal 27 -- The Outsiders' Cure
---

Long day. Long week. Busy month. No catchy intro. Apologies. Enjoy!

<!--excerpt-->

----------------------------------------

A town is ravaged by a baffling plague. Local healers concoct elixirs to relieve the people’s suffering, but supplies soon run out. Then a group of outsiders come, offering a seemingly magical cure for the town’s plague. Desperate, people take the outsiders’ medicine. At first, it seems to work. The plague leaves. But then the “cured” start showing symptoms – ones that are far stranger and far worse than before. Has the plague returned? Are these side effects of the cure? Who are these outsiders? Is there anyone healthy enough to find the truth?
