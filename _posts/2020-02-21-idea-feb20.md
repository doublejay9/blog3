title: Idea You Can Steal 34 -- The Secret Town
---

It's mid-February, and it looks like I'm not going to get any more snow this winter. And all I did get lasted for two days. Climate change or bad luck? I'll let you decide.

Once you're done pondering that weather conundrum, here's a story idea for you.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------------

A foreign traveler is waylaid by bandits and left for dead. Some time later, a priest passes by and finds the poor soul unconscious on the side of the road. Seeing that the injured traveler isn’t from around here, the priest takes them to a hidden village built inside a network of caves. Why is the existence of this village a secret? Why are the residents so friendly with the priest? How do the residents react to a newcomer in their midst? How will the foreigner react to the villagers once they recover? What is this town’s story anyway?
