Hello, readers.

2020 has been a year, hasn't it? I think it's safe to assume that most of us will be wishing it good riddance come New Year's Eve.

<!--excerpt-->

I faced my own professional and financial struggles this year, and I'm very grateful that they turned out to be relatively mild compared to others'. A family who can pool enough resources to help you out of a situation you created is a true blessing. And even though cruel 2020 passed out hardship to everyone like Christmas cookies, it wouldn't be fair to say nothing good happened this year. My beloved writing forum, [LegendFire,](https://forum.legendfire.com) resurrected in September. These past few months have been amazing reconnecting with old faces (well, more like screen names and profile pictures) and rebuilding our online hang-out spot to its former glory.

What I'm proudest of in 2020 is what I achieved on this blog. Not one but two series this year -- both of them unplanned. In June, I published ["Crystal Towers"](https://apprenticewordsmith.com/2020/06/26/ff-crystal-towers/) which became the prologue for a novel-length piece I'm currently serializing as my monthly Friday Fiction feature. It's been a few years since I've worked on a long, meaty story, and the monthly deadline has been a good motivator to steadily finish each section. I'm sliding back into a familiar groove, and it feels wonderful.

I will release Part 5 of "On the Red Line" along with an Idea to Steal later this month. There's plenty to come in 2021 -- the last few parts of "On the Red Line", the continuation of that massive story arc which I've unofficially titled *Reclaiming the City*, and that promised sequel post to [this year's](https://apprenticewordsmith.com/2020/03/13/dark-stories1/) [dark](https://apprenticewordsmith.com/2020/04/10/dark-stories2/) [stories](https://apprenticewordsmith.com/2020/05/08/dark-stories3/) [series.](https://apprenticewordsmith.com/2020/06/12/dark-stories4/)

Long time readers will know that I've been working towards a platform move for about two years now. While that is still something I'm interested in doing one day, I realized this year that GitHub's platform (the one I'm currently on) grew up while I wasn't looking. That's going to be my primary blog project for 2021 -- implementing some desperately needed functionality and give this site a fresh coat of paint. I don't know how monkeying with the code will mess with things on your end, so I'll post a notice before I try anything too drastic.

Thanks again, readers, for sticking with me through this wild year. I know things don't look so great now, but I have hope for 2021. At the very least, I have a huge stack of fuel for my creative endeavors. I hope you also have inspiration and a story idea or two to carry you into the new year. For now, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.

**What were some good things that happened to you this year? What were you able to accomplish creatively? Anything you're proud of? What are your hopes for 2021? I'd love to hear all about it in the comments.**
