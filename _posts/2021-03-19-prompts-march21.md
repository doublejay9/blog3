Here's your monthly set of writing prompts, as promised. I'll settle back into my normal posting order in April.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Many old legends warn against upsetting the spirits of forests and streams. What does our hapless main character do completely by accident that offends them? How do the spirits get their revenge?

2. We're told to be careful what we wish for. What we're not told as often is to be careful whose wishes we grant. Write a story where the wisher tries to use their wish against the granter.

3. The main character of your story is a referee for a youth sports league: little league baseball, kids' soccer, neighborhood swim teams, etc.

4. Write a story where family members act maliciously toward each other. Bonus points if the victims are male and the perpetrators female.

5. A kingdom wishes to make peace with the tribes menacing their borders. How well do the tribes receive the diplomats and their entourage? Do the tribes agree to the terms of the peace treaty?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
