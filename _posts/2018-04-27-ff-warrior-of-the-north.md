title: Friday Flash 4 -- Warrior of the North

*Inspired by [“Wolfborn” by BrunuhVille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za8eYjQ7Nz8)*

You walk through a dark forest, down from the mountain. Snow swirls at your feet, obscuring the path ahead, erasing your footprints behind. No name, no home, a past forgotten and gone. Only your life to lose. You are nobody, another stranger from the north.

<!--excerpt-->

Yet, in time, you earn a place in this foreign land, carved with arrow and blade. A reputation written in blood. Some love you. Some hate you. Death follows at your heels.

This is not the life you wished for, yet you exist, warrior of the north. History will remember you.
