title: Idea You Can Steal 9 -- Stone of Fascination
---

Summer may be ending, but your writing doesn't have to. Here's an idea you can use as the season winds down.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------------

There is a type of crystal known as Stone of Fascination. To the sane, it appears as nothing more than cheap glass. To the insane, however, it appears as a gem of exquisite beauty and brilliance. According to legend, those on the brink of a psychotic crisis see these crystals glow with a blue, otherworldly light. They are utterly captivated by it, and some legends tell of how Stones of Fascination were used to lure the insane to a particular location. Nothing is known about the Stones’ origins, but their frequent appearance in eldritch lore have led many to suggest a connection.
