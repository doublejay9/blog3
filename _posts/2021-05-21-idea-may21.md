title: Idea You Can Steal 52 -- Two Escape
---

My town is in the middle of a heat wave. Summer is definitely around the bend. Here's a story idea to keep you occupied when the weather in your town gets unbearable.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------------

Our two main characters find themselves trapped in a remote facility. The circumstances surrounding their abduction, the identity and motives of their kidnappers, and what happened during their imprisonment are entirely up to you. One is badly wounded but knows of a way out. The other is strong enough to protect the former but has trouble remembering things. How do the pair escape?
