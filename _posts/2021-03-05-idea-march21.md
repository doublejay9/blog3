title: Idea You Can Steal 49 -- Meet Their Maker
---

Doing something different this month by starting off with an Idea to Steal, rather than a pack of writing prompts. Don't worry. Prompts will come later in March.

<!--excerpt-->

--------------------

A renowned engineer dedicates their career to building mechanical soldiers for their nation's army. Circumstances beyond the engineer's control face them to abandon the project and the completed prototypes. Many years later, the prototypes gain a rudimentary type of sentience, and with it came a desire to meet their creator. Will the robots find their maker? Will their maker accept them? Can these robots built for war get along with peacetime society?
