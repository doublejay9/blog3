title: Idea You Can Steal 19 -- The Case of the Missing Assistant
---

March has one last Friday for us, so here's a bonus story idea for you.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------

A scientist is on trial for the alleged murder of an assistant. They were testing teleportation technology, and the assistant disappeared. The trial is interrupted by an elderly person forcing their way into the courtroom. They claim to be the missing assistant. Is this true? Can the police prove it? Did the teleportation experiment actually work? Or is there a far more complicated plot unfolding here?
