Spring is nearly here. (Or fall, if you're in the southern hemisphere.) Here's a bouquet of prompts to start a new season of writing.

<!--excerpt-->

1. A monarch leaves their kingdom to go in search of something. What? Do they find it? Do they ever return home? What happens to their kingdom while they're gone?

2. The main character is jealous of a philanthropist's wealth. How does the main character act out their jealousy? What do they do to smear the philanthropist's good name?

3. The main character owns a radio station. A local politician wants to shut them down. Why? How does the politician make the main character's life hell? What does the main character do to save their business?

4. Write a story where the characters are trapped in a cave.

5. The main character allies with a figure known only as Trickster. Who is Trickster? Why does the main character trust them? What does the main character gain from this alliance?
