title: Idea You Can Steal 1 -- The True Tyrant
---

As I explained [earlier this month](https://apprenticewordsmith.com//2018/01/01/whats-coming-in-2018/), Ideas You Can Steal are longer, meatier writing prompts. A scenario and direction for the plot are suggested, but the details and ending are completely up to you. Take this idea wholesale as a kind of outline, or cut it apart to use as inspiration for multiple projects.

<!--excerpt-->

------------------------------

A religious leader and a small band of disciples are imprisoned by the tyrannical king. A female disciple is taken up to the palace, since she is to be the king's newest concubine. But when the disciple meets the king, she discovers that he is a frail, sickly man. He has no concubines, nor does he intend to make the disciple one. As their conservation progresses, she realizes that the king has little idea about what is going on in his kingdom. She wonders who the true tyrant is.
