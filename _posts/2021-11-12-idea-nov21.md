title: Idea You Can Steal 59 -- The City of Doors
---

I don't like posting prompts and story ideas back to back, but work is forcing my hand. Day jobs. What can you do?

<!--excerpt-->

------------------------

The City of Doors is a place where multiple worlds/universes/dimensions meet and overlap, allowing easy travel between them. Most who visit this place are simply travelers passing through. But a few call the city home. Write a story centered on a few of these natives or on one native in particular.
