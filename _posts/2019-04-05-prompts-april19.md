I promised myself that I wouldn't give you to the "April showers" line again this year, but since it's been raining all day, it's all I can think about. So I might've failed to deliver a pithy intro, but I still have five new writing prompts for you.

<!--excerpt-->

1. A port city is being used as a bargaining chip in the feud between rival barons. How do the city's leaders feel about this? Will they take it any more?

2. Humanity has nuked themselves into extinction. How do the remaining animals survive in the wasteland left behind?

3. A couple are traveling to spend a holiday with family. They end up getting stranded somewhere along the way. How will they reach their destination now?

4. The main character became a workaholic to meet their parent's high expectations. That parent has recently passed away. Will the main character finally take time for themselves? Or will old habits die hard?

5. A foreign correspondent is called to the scene of a riot. The main character is the underpaid and overworked cameraperson who has to accompany the journalist.

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
