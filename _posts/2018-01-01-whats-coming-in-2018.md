title: What's Coming in 2018
---

Dear Readers,

I haven't been the kind of person who makes resolutions. Well, except the resolution to not make any resolutions. ;) I didn't want some arbitrary goal to get in the way of finding unexpected success in the coming year. But one of the lessons that 2017 taught me was the value of intentionality. If you want to find success, you have to actively go looking for it. I still believe in unexpected success, but the unexpected can't happen unless you aren't investing effort somewhere. So with all of that in mind, I'm bucking my usual trend and making one resolution for 2018.

<!--excerpt-->

**I resolve to publish one blog post per week.**

I'm making a commitment to Apprentice Wordsmith and you the reader to give you something new every Friday. This is the most important part of my efforts to actively search for more readers and grow my audience. Every community needs something to form itself around. For a blog, that's a steady stream of content, and as Apprentice Wordsmith's owner and writer, it's my responsibility to provide that.

The problem is that the kind of posts I have been making take time to write -- weeks, sometimes months. I knew that I could never meet this goal with those kinds of posts alone. Thus, I'm introducing three new types of posts you'll see in 2018.

**Writing Prompts** -- Since I last posted, the LegendFire forum has shut down. In its last few months, I helped one of the moderators create weekly writing prompts. I had a lot of fun coming up with these prompts. I had nearly four months' worth ready to go, longer than the remaining lifespan of the forum. I'd like to continue the tradition here on Apprentice Wordsmith with a set of five prompts every month. (These will typically be posted on the first Friday of the month.) Use one every week. Use them to fuel five days' worth of writing. Or just pick and choose the ones that inspire you.

**Ideas You Can Steal** -- Sometimes, imagination only needs a spark to ignite. Other times, more fuel is required. That's where these ideas come in. While writing prompts are a couple of sentences each, Ideas to Steal are at least a paragraph long. Think of them as a more developed story seed, with a couple of (loosely defined) characters and a scenario. The details and the ending, of course, are all up to you.

**Friday Flash** -- The hardest problem an aspiring writer will face is simply being known, getting their work in front of readers. It's something I'm going to tackle in 2018 by releasing a piece of flash fiction or prose poetry on Fridays. It may not be every month, but I currently have enough drafts to release one per month for most of 2018. Why am I offering stuff for free? The simplest answer is that if I can't impress you for free, then I don't deserve your money.

I hope you're looking forward to these additions. The premiere set of writing prompts will be posted on the 5th. Till then, here's to a new year filled with creativity and success.
