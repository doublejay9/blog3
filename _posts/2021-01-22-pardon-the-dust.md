title: Pardon the Dust [Site Downtime Announcement]
---

Hey everyone. I'm finally ready to implement some major updates to the blog. Here's a few things I need to warn you about.

* **Site will be down from noon Saturday (January 23) to 5pm Monday (January 25) US Eastern Standard Time.** Depending on how quickly servers update, the site may be back up early, but I still need 48 hours to make sure the changes take effect.

* **This site will no longer use Disqus comments.** If you want to save anything you posted in the comments section, please do so before the site goes down, else the content will be lost.

* There won't be any new posts until the updates are complete. If this is the first one you see, then I'm still working in the background.

I fully expect the blog to look wonky and my backlog to be incomplete once it's back online. Please be patient while I clean up and restore all of my previous posts.

See you on the other side!
