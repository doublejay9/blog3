The weather's warming. The daffodils are blooming. And here's a brand new group of writing prompts.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Prohibition has finally been lifted. How does the public celebrate? Bonus points if a) your story isn't set in 1930s America or b) the prohibition was against something other than alcohol or a drug.

2. Write a story where the main character's lies nearly cost them their life.

3. The winners of a competition treat the losers to a meal. The competition could be a sports match, a quiz show, a mock battle between friendly nations, or something else entirely. What do the competitors learn about each other? What bonds are forged, and how are they made?

4. A spy lands in a sticky situation. Literally. How did they end up covered in mysterious goo? How does the goo jeopardize their mission?

5. Write a mystery that takes place during a masquerade ball.

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
