title: Idea You Can Steal 44 -- Lost in the Clockwork City
---

I ended up with a full plate of work this month. So I’m sneaking this story idea to you under the table before I hit the grind again.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------------------

The main character finds themselves in a mysterious clockwork city located between dimensions. They’re also wanted for a crime they don’t remember committing. They soon find an unlikely ally in the daughter of the city’s ruler. Why is she helping our main character? Why can’t the main character shake the feeling that they’ve met this woman before?
