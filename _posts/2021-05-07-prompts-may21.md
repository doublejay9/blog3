Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in the audience. Here's a bouquet of writing prompts for you to enjoy.

<!--excerpt-->

1. The main character is a hermit. What made them forsake the world? What did they hope to gain in solitude? What could persuade them to come back to civilization?

2. Our main character has made an enemy of a secret society. What did they do to anger the society? How does the society attempt to exact their revenge? 

3. An artist is forced to abandon their masterwork. How? Why? Will they ever get a chance to finish it? 

4. Write a fantasy story set completely within a sorcerer's tower.

5. The main character is the advisor and confidante of a ruler. The ruler is heading down a wayward path. Perhaps they are showing signs of tyranny, or they are warming up to an alliance that would spell the nation's doom. How does our main character attempt to stop the ruler before it's too late?
