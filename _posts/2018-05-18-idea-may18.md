title: Idea You Can Steal 6 -- The Tainted Three
---

A belated Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in the audience. Here's my story idea for May.

<!--excerpt-->

-------------------------------------

A ruined knight, a demon-possessed man, and a woman with amnesia cross paths one night near a lonely, roadside inn. All three have been “tainted” by the Abyss. As the woman works to reconstruct her lost memories, she discovers that her fate is entwined with those of the knight and the demon-possessed man. Their fate, whatever it is, will lead all of them back to the Abyss.
