Forgive me if I don't have a clever intro for this week's post. My grandmother has been dealing with some heavy medical trouble, so priorities needed to be shifted around. But I didn't want to neglect you readers completely. So here are five writing prompts to spark your April sessions.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Write about a group who rescues their friend from their enemies' lair.

2. A guide is leading a group of monks through the wilderness. What about the wilderness is strange -- unusual even to the guide? Why doesn't the guide warn the monks about the danger right away?

3. Write a story that involves deceiving a military officer.

4. Write a story that takes place during an uprising.

5. Write about a leader who is undone not by their weakness, but by their own strength.

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
