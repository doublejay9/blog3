---

The calendar has given March an extra Friday, so here's a bonus story idea for your Easter basket. Enjoy!

<!--excerpt-->

----------------------------------

A department store chain has decided to stop printing paper coupons and offer digital coupons via a mobile app. One loyal customer, a sweet yet stubborn grandmother, complains to store management. She doesn't want to get a smartphone and "If I can't get my coupons, I can't shop here anymore." Weeks pass. The grandmother hasn't come back to the store. Management notices that they're losing money fast. Will the store fail because of this one grandmother? Or will management go against corporate policy to keep the store afloat?
