It's the most wonderful time of the year. And the busiest. I hope you can grab a few moments for yourself and your writing this December. Here are a few prompts to get you warmed up.

<!--excerpt-->

1. A convicted criminal is going to be publicly executed. "Any last words?" they are asked. What they say shocks the crowd. Why? What happens because of this revelation?

2. A letter is finally delivered 20 years after it was written. Who wrote it? Who was the intended recipient? What does the letter say? (Bonus points if it's not a love letter.)

3. A young noble has been robbed and now is in need of armed guards. What was stolen? Where do they find mercenaries? Do the noble and their new guards ever track down the thief?

4. The main character has big plans. About what? These plans are foiled by a family member in the end. How?

5. Write a fight scene from the loser's point of view.

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
