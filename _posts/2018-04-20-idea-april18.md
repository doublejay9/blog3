title: Idea You Can Steal 5 -- Ghost in the Crystal
---

There aren't any holidays coming up, so I'll cut my usual fluff and say "Here's your monthly idea to steal."

<!--excerpt-->

------------------------------

To avoid death, a mage transfers their soul into a crystal. The ritual is a success, but it drains all of the mage’s strength. Many years later, an adventuring prince and his companions find this crystal. Soon, the prince starts hearing a voice in his head, advising him. It’s the mage’s ghost, newly awakened from its long slumber. Awkwardness, and perhaps wacky hijinxs, ensue as the trust between adviser and royal deepens.
