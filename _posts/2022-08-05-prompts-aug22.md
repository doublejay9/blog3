Don't mind me. Just sneaking in a set of writing prompts while there's a break in the thunderstorms.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Why did a mob of senior citizens burn down the local country club in the middle of the night?

2. A civil war ends in a stalemate. Who are the unlucky souls charged by both sides to broker a truce? How can two factions who utterly hate each other build a lasting peace agreement between them?

3. Write about an inheritance dispute over a business. Who will own it -- the founder's family or the current manager? Here's the twist: everyone is fighting over a failing business.

4. The ruler of a country publicly and systematically attacks followers of a certain religion. What did this group do to provoke the ruler's wrath? Bonus points if the ruler's charges against these people are at least partially true.

5. An ex-convict admits to her therapist that the huge corporation which (graciously) gave her a job feels eerily like prison. What must she do to finally regain true freedom? How can the therapist be an ally in this story?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
