title: Idea You Can Steal 33 -- Surprise in the Will
---

It’s Super Bowl weekend. It’s also the last Friday in January. So here’s a bonus story idea you can work on between rounds of sports-ball. (I clearly don’t know much about football.)

-------------------------------------

A recently deceased celebrity’s family is surprised to hear a strange name when the will is read. Nobody around the table knows who this mystery heir is, so a nation-wide search begins. The paparazzi get the name and, naturally, publish it in the tabloids. Soon, a line of people all claiming to be the mystery heir come forward. How can the family determine which is the true heir? Why would the celebrity leave a sizable inheritance to this person anyway?
