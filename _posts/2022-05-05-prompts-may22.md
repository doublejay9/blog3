So I'm publishing this post from the campus library at my sister's college. I'm in town for her graduation. The actual ceremony is tomorrow, which is why I'm posting a day early. For everybody who doesn't have big plans for the coming weekend, here are a set of writing prompts for your imagination to chew on.

<!--excerpt-->

1. What lengths will a character go to protect a prized possession?

2. The main character finally snaps under the weight of growing expectations. Desperate, what do they do to escape?

3. Write about a pair of characters healing their strained relationship. Bonus points if the relationship in question is not a romantic one.

4. A greedy character seeks a crystal ball (or some other divination tool) whose predictions always come true. How does this fortune-telling artifact become their downfall?

5. The main character falls prey to a stranger's scheme. What is it? How does the main character persevere throung the hardships that inevitably follow? What must they risk to escape their fate?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
