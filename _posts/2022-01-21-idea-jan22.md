title: Idea You Can Steal 62 -- A Strange Woman, An Old Friend, and a Curious String of Coincidences
---

My town got a lot of show these past two weeks. Then melted away a few days later. So far, a typical winter around here.

Here's a story idea you can play with the next time you're stuck inside because of weather.

<!--excerpt-->

--------------------------------

A strange woman comes to visit the main character. She wears a necklace that once belonged to an old friend of the main character -- a man they haven't seen in years. The stranger tells of how this man saved her life, gave her his necklace, and told her to find the main character. "He wants me to help you in your quest."

The main character isn't on a quest right now, but one soon presents itself. What kind of adventure is the main character being called to? What skills does the stranger bring to the table? Who is she anyway? And how does the old friend factor into all of this? What has become of him? What does he know?
