title: Idea You Can Steal 17 -- A Working Family
---

Happy Valentine's Day, readers! As a token of my love, here's a story idea.

<!--excerpt-->

----------------------------------

A family – poor and homeless – go from factory to factory asking for work. The parents aren’t the only ones asking; the children are too. Eventually, they all find work, but each family member is going to different factories. Thus, the family is forced to work long hours at separate factories and sleep in separate company dorms. Will they ever be reunited?
