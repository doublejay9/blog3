Happy July 4th, America! Here's some writing prompts to spark your imagination.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Write a story set in the ruins of a religious site -- a burned down church, a temple reclaimed by nature, a flooded shrine, etc.

2. No one wants to get on the bad side of a weathermaker -- a sorcerer with the power to control the weather. Write about a time when a weathermaker unleashed their magical fury on one of their enemies.

3. The main character is forced to decide between their survival, their allies, and a chance for revenge. Which do they choose? Why?

4. Write about a character born to a powerful political family but gave it all up to explore the world.
