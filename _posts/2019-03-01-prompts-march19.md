Hi, readers. How's 2019 been treating you so far? It's still treating me well, professionally speaking. Unfortunately, that means I haven't had much time for my creative projects. Entering the second month now. Sigh.

But don't let my woes slow you down. Here are some prompts to kickstart your creativity.

<!--excerpt-->

1. The main character wants to run a marathon. Their family and friends aren't thrilled about this. How will the main character persevere?

2. Write a story about a cult that worships an AI.

3. We're told to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. What happens when your enemy knows you better than your best friend does? What happens when your enemy uses that knowledge against you?

4. The main character returns home after serving time in jail. How do they rebuild their reputation?

5. The two parties in a lawsuit are trying to settle out of court, as per their attornies' suggestion. The discussion spirals out of control. How? Why?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
