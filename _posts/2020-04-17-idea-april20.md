Corona-chan is still on her world tour. Hope all of you are staying safe, healthy, and sane. Here’s another juicy Idea You Can Steal to help pass the time.

<!--excerpt-->

--------------------------------------------

Does it completely collapse into anarchy? Does a new religion devoted to a new deity rise in its place? What do the clergy of the old religion do to honor their god’s legacy?
