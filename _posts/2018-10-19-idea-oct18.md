title: Idea You Can Steal 12 -- The Alluring Hunt
---

Is it too early to say "Happy Halloween?" Doesn't matter. I already did. And here's an idea to inspire your late night writing.

<!--excerpt-->

---------------------------------

The hunt has come again. Portals to the underworld have opened, spilling forth all sorts of supernatural monsters. A young couple is caught outside that night. Luckily, they are rescued by a hunter who leads them to a safe hideout.

The hunt and the night are lasting longer than anyone anticipated. One half of the couple, being the curious sort, starts asking more and more questions about the hunt, the underworld, and its monsters. Eventually, their curiosity leads them outside and into danger. Their significant other is very concerned, but the other, older refugees just shake their heads. “The hunt is alluring, and once ensnared, it never lets you go.”
