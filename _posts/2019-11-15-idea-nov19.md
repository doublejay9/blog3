title: Idea You Can Steal 29 -- A Deal with Mischief
---

Going over the river and through the woods to Grandmother's house soon? Even if you don't celebrate Thanksgiving (or have already celebrated Thanksgiving), I'm sure Grandma would appreciate hearing from you. And to show my appreciation to my readers, here's a story idea.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------------------

The main character becomes trapped in an alternate, chaotic dimension. Fragments of their home world collide and combine to form an ever-changing landscape. (How the main character got here is for you to determine.) A supernatural entity soon appears, claiming to be the embodiment of mischief and the ruler of this dimension. The main character wants to go home. Mischief is willing to help, for a price. What price does Mischief demand? How long is the main character forced to stay in the realm of chaos?
