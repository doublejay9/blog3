title: Idea You Can Steal 39 -- The Lost Tribe
---

It's been raining all day today, so here's me slipping in a story idea for you before it starts thundering again.

<!--excerpt-->

---------------------------

A warlike tribe, infamous for their brutality and conquests, mysteriously vanishes. Centuries later, an archaeologist studying their ruins finds evidence that suggests how and why the tribe disappeared. What is this evidence? Why does the current government want it? Why are they blocking any further excavations? What will the archaeologist be risking if they decide to press on with their research?
