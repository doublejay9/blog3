title: Idea You Can Steal 37 -- The Box of Letters
---

A belated Happy Mother's Day to all of the moms in the audience. Here's this month's free story idea.

<!--excerpt-->

-------------------------------------

The main character is cleaning out their grandparent's garage/basement/attic/etc when they discover a box of unmailed letters written over the span of decades. The main character doesn't recognize the names of the writer or the intended recipient. Neither one are family members. The grandparent knows about these letters, but the story behind them isn't an easy one to tell. Who are the writer and intended recipient? How does the grandparent know them? How did the letters come into the grandparent's possession? Why were the letters never mailed?
