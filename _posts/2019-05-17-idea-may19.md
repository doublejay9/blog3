title: Idea You Can Steal 21 -- Keeping the Case Cold
---

May has been an interesting and busy month for me, so no pithy intro I'm afraid. But I do have a story idea you can steal.

<!--excerpt-->

----------------------------------

Evidence in a 10-year-old case has just surfaced. Whatever it is, the evidence strongly suggests that the original investigation and trial was corrupt. Our main characters want to reopen the case, but their superiors are doing everything they can to keep the case closed. Why? Is there some larger conspiracy at work? How deep does it go?
