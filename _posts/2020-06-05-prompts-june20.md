It's summertime! Sadly, there's a lot of crazy stuff happening that I'm sure has put a damper on your usual summer plans. Yet I hope you can find time and a sunny spot to write this month. Here's some prompts to get you started.

<!--excerpt-->

1. A small-time musician (or artist or athlete or whatever) gets into a beef with a big-time celebrity. Does the little guy even stand a chance? Is justice on their side? How does this affect both of their careers?

2. In an age before cars (and cell phones), a group travelling through a mountain pass finds the path blocked by rocks. The rocks can't be easily cleared. How do they find a way around this obstacle?

3. Sports teams trash-talking each other before a match is nothing new. What happens when trash-talk spirals into something worse, and an athlete is hell-bent on seeing the opposition crushed? Are their teammates cool with this?

4. Take your typical jock and your typical nerd and make them best friends. The jock wants to help the nerd become more popular at school. How well or badly does this pan out? How does the nerd feel about all this?

5. Write a modern-day story set in an old-fashioned restaurant or pub.

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
