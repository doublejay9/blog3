Got any exciting summer plans? None for me, right now. Regardless of how much (or how little) you'll be doing this season, here are some prompts you can chew on in between.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Three warriors swear an oath upon a sword. What is this oath? Are all of them able to keep it?

2. The main character's dream is irreparably shattered. The goal they worked so hard to achieve is now permanently out of reach. How did this happen? How does the main character react?

3. A citizen becomes convinced that, in order to save their community, they must destroy it. What threat are they saving it from? This threat eventually becomes more real and dangerous than neighbors initially suspected. Is there a solution where no one has to suffer?

4. Write a story set in a massive library.

5. Our heroes had thought that they could rid their home of some evil by vanquishing their enemies once and for all. Which of their assumptions is now revealed to be completely wrong? How does new knowledge change how they view their former foe?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
