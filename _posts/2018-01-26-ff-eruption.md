*Inspired by [“Volcano Dance” by Jonathan Yandel](https://jonathanyandel.bandcamp.com/track/volcano-dance)*

Amber, liquid rock leaps toward the stars. The mountain remakes itself before their eyes. Little creatures with black and yellow scales raise their limbs in praise.

<!--excerpt-->

A silver ball, the visitors' probe, flies closer to watch. Garlands of grass and bone ring the creatures' necks and tails. Drums beat. The creatures sing, a long drone that echoes the churning earth beneath them.

A sharp cry interrupts their song. The probe is spotted. Most flee, screaming. Some shake spears in fearful anger. Others throw rocks. Lens cracked, the probe retreats into the night.

Safe within their hidden ship, the visitors watch the little creatures run back into the forest. An amber river flows down the mountain, devouring the ritual site.
