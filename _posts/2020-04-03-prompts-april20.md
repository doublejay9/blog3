I hope you're finding ways to enjoy nature, even if it's just admiring the spring flowers or fall leaves from your window. Here are some more writing prompts for you to try out.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Write a story where the characters trick a law enforcement officer (sheriff, Captain of the Guard, a planetary peace-keeping agent, etc).

2. A deadly disease breaks out inside a prison. How do the wardens struggle to contain in and maintain order? What do they discover about the disease's origin? How does the situation quickly go to hell in a handbasket?

3. Little does a kind-hearted monarch know that revolution is brewing in their kingdom. Why do the people want to overthrow the monarchy? How do the monarch's ministers and advisors try to shelter them from the coming storm? Can the monarch do anything to save themselves?

4. Write a tournament arc -- a story following a tournament-style competition and the competitors. The protagonist is a novice street magician from a small town. The competition is a talent show which has a special category for magicians and illusionists. Think of reality shows like *America's Got Talent* but specifically for stage magic.

5. An ordinary drunken brawl outside a bar ends up re-igniting an ancient family feud. It's not long before the current generation clashes in the streets. Will cooler heads prevail and persuade the families to bury the hatchet for good? Or will the matriarchs and patriarchs tread the violent path of their ancestors?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
