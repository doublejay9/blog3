The leaves have finally turned and are starting to fall. Just like these writing prompts are falling onto this blog. (Okay. Not one of my better segues.) Here's your batch of five for November.

<!--excerpt-->

1. The story takes place during a peace summit. Write about the chef who impresses all of the diplomats with their cooking.

2. The main character enters a ruined temple and performs a small ritual. What are they asking the old gods for? Why ask the old gods and not those of the state religion?

3. Write a story from the point of view of a magician's rabbit.

4. Following a bloody coup, a servant must either swear loyalty to the new ruler or face death as a traitor. What does the servant do?

5. A celebrity makes a mistake that ruins their reputation. What was the mistake?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
