title: Idea You Can Steal 13 -- The Shy Guardian
---

I'm thankful for a lot of things this year, including my readers. To show my gratitude, here's a free story idea in time for Turkey Day.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------------

A village is guarded by a mysterious figure named Black. After rescuing a group of children, the village wants to honor Black with a public feast. Yet Black cowers in the face of this attention and is all but dragged into town in order to attend. Does Black ever say why people makes them nervous? What must happen before the village honors Black’s request for obscurity?
