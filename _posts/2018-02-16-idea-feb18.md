title: Idea You Can Steal 2 -- The Monk and the Enigneer
---

Happy (belated) Valentine's Day, readers! Or Singles Appreciation Day. Or Hearts Day. Whatever you call February 14th. Anyway, here's another story idea you can steal.

<!--excerpt-->

--------------------------

A robot monk comes down with a nasty computer virus. The monk's human friends bring in a retired robotics engineer to help. This engineer is part of the "old school" and believes robots are just machines. Fixing the monk is difficult enough. The monk's followers questioning the engineer's motives and intentions at every turn makes the situation worse.
