title: Idea You Can Steal 14 -- The Biodome Colony
---

November has one Friday left. So here's an extra story idea before we say goodbye to this month.

<!--excerpt-->

--------------------------------

A group of space-farers are forced to make an emergency landing on some out of the way planet. They meet a civilization of friendly aliens there who graciously invite the space-farers to stay in their biodome town. Many of the space-farers make fast friends with their alien hosts; others remain skeptical. These aliens are being just a little too friendly.

One of the skeptics encounters a ghost who leads them to the town’s central fountain. Hidden at the bottom of the fountain are tablets written in an intergalactic language, one the space-farers have seen before. The tablets reveal the tragic downfall of the town’s prior inhabitants, and the friendly aliens’ sinister ulterior motives.
