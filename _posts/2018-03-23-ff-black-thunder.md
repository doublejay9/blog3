*Inspired by [“Blackened Soul” by Adrian von Ziegler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-laiCZ2fr14)*

Clouds gather overhead, black against the evening sun. Wind flees before the army, turning up the leaves on the trees.

<!--excerpt-->

We huddle inside as the sky roars. Bullets of rain clatter against the windows. Sheets of silver brush over the land like layers of a veil.

The storm's wrath sated, it retreats. We emerge into dampness to survey the remnants of chaos. The world returns to its senses as steam rises from the asphalt.
