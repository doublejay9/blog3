---

Tomorrow is Halloween! Hope all of you have a happy one, however you're celebrating this year. Here's a bonus treat for your candy basket.

<!--excerpt-->

-------------------------

A strange robot child runs to our main character, begging for their help. The child doesn’t remember much about themselves or their past. They only remember who they’re running from. “They’re gonna kill me. They’re gonna take me apart.” Later, this same group of shady characters visit the main character’s home and ask about the robot child. Does the main character successfully protect the frightened robot? Will they ever discover the child’s true origins?
