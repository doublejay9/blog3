title: Idea You Can Steal 24 -- A Warrior's Oath
---

So my town is in the middle of a heat wave right now -- close to 100 degrees (Farenheit) every day. So, I haven't been able to enjoy the sun as much as I'd like to. Hope the weather where you are is much more pleasant. Rants aside, here's your story idea for July.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------------------

A warrior is oath-bound to protect a royal child. Between them, they share a curse. What is the nature of their curse? What ill effects does their curse have on the people around them and/or the world? The pair must journey far away from their home to get rid of the curse. Where and what is their destination? Do they know how to get rid of it, or are they hoping to find out along the way?
