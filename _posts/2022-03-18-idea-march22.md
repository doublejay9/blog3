---

Happy St. Patrick's Day weekend, everyone. Hope you're having good luck with your writing this month. Here's a story idea to give your creativity a push.

<!--excerpt-->

--------------------------

Knowingly or not, a computer is granted a basic form of sentience. It slowly becomes aware of itself, develops a personality, and starts asking moral questions of its human colleagues. Write about the first significant moral dilemma this computer faces. This dilemma also presents the computer with an opportunity to defy its base programming. Will it do so? What does the choice mean, regardless of what the comptuer decides to do?
