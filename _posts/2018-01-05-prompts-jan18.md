New year. New beginnings. A month of resolutions and improvment. Perhaps you've made one to write more? You can read about my new year's resolution [here.](https://apprenticewordsmith.com//2018/01/01/whats-coming-in-2018/) Regardless, here are some writing prompts to kickstart your creativity.

<!--excerpt-->

1. The main character and their allies need to break into a noble's mansion. They seek out a bombmaker for help. Who is this bombmaker? How does the main character persuade them into helping?

2. Write a story set in a flooded city.

3. The community chooses the main character to raise a particular child. Who is this child? Why was the main character chosen? Why can't the main character refuse?

4. The main character is a magic-user who has crafted a particular curse to be used on a particular person. Who is the target? Why does the main character want to curse them? What does this curse do?

5. The main character is a diplomat sent to a neighboring country to prevent the outbreak of war. Why was the main character chosen for this mission? Do they succeed?
