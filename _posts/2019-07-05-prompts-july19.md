I hope all of my American readers had a happy Fourth of July. Here's some writing prompts to keep your summer groove rolling.

<!--excerpt-->

1. A genius villain is about to unleash their death device upon a major metropolis. How do the city's resident superheroes thwart this plan before their home is wiped from the map? Bonus points if the superheroes aren't respected by the citizens.

2. Our elderly protagonist loves their vintage car. Neighborhood kids damage it with their runaway ball. How does the protagonist get revenge?

3. A parent dictates who their child is friends with, when they see each other, and what they do together. How does the child attempt to break free of their parent's control? Does the parent take it well?

4. A snake oil salesperson comes to town to advertise their wares. One virtuous citizen manages to expose the merchant as a fraud. Here's the twist: the snake oil salesperson is the protagonist. For an extra challenge, make them a sympathetic character too.

5. The main character is undergoing some kind of test. In this case, failure is the better option. How so?
