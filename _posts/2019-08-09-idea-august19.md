title: Idea You Can Steal 25 -- "I need to go"
---

So I'm changing things up this month and giving you August's first Idea to Steal this week.

*Changing things up? Wait. You lied to us?!*

Sorry, all, but I need a little more time to complete the next installment of the Dealer series. In the meantime, here's a meaty story idea for you to chew on.

<!--excerpt-->

----------------------------

Someone close to the main character (a friend, parent, sibling, significant other, etc) tells them that they need to travel to a foreign country. Tragically, this person dies before they get the chance. Some time later, the main character journeys to this foreign country. While there, they find the dearly departed's name associated with a high-profile scandal. (How the main character discovers this is up to you.) What happened? Is this why the main character's friend/parent/sibling/etc "needed" to come here? Will the main character figure out the full truth before they return home? How can the main character make things right or at least set the record straight?
