title: I'm in an Anthology [News]
---

This summer, [LegendFire's](https://forum.legendfire.com/) admin -- you know her as Raveneye -- decided to compile the best pieces from the forum's contests into a free anthology. My entry in one of the weekly 100 word contests met her submission criteria. [Now, I've been published in an ebook.](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1106545)

You can grab a copy of the anthology for yourself at the link above. It's completely free. Look for "The Hardest Job" in the 100 Words Weekly Challenge section.

I don't have much else to say other than I'm glad to be one step closer to having legitimate writer street cred. Though, if I'm perfectly honest, this anthology couldn't have come out at a better time. I need to work on *Reclaiming the City*, and this post gives me a bit longer to chase down my muse, the scaredy cat.
