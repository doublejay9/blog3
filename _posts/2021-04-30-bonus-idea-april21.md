title: Idea You Can Steal 51 -- Getting Back to Business
---

For April's bonus idea, imagine a trade guild. If you're not familiar with these organizations, you may want to briefly read up on the medieval trade guilds of Europe or today's labor unions.

<!--excerpt-->

------------------------

Internal politics are threatening to tear the guild apart. The guild's ever-shifting demands are making it harder and harder for the tradespeople to do business. It's starting to affect other people and guilds further back in the supply chain: the miners who supply ore to the blacksmiths, the weavers and spinners who supply thread and fabric to the tailors, etc.

A group of junior guild members notice how bad things have gotten and decide to do something about it. (Depending on how your guild is organized, these can be journeymen, newly-minted technicians, and/or less influential masters.) How do they operate outside of the guild to salvage their incomes and businesses? Do they cook up a scheme to show the guild's feuding leaders how royally they are messing things up for everybody? Will these junior members form a third faction which aims to restore the guild to what it once was?
