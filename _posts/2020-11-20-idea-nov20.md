title: Idea You Can Steal 46 -- "Drive the outsider from our midst!"
---

November is a month for counting blessings, few they may be this year. I hope my prompts and free story ideas have blessed your writing sessions. Speaking of which, here's your free idea for November.

<!--excerpt-->

--------------------------------

A missionary comes to a remote village to spread their faith. The people don't accept the missionary's gospel, yet they don't respond in anger. Instead, the villagers wait till nightfall to gleefully chase the missionary with torches and weapons. Does the missionary escape with their life? Do they suffer a fate worse than death at the villagers' hands? For a twist, write from the villagers' perspective.
