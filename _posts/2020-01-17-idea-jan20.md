title: Idea You Can Steal 32 -- An Old Romance

My town finally got snow last week. It lasted a full two days before a freak warm spell melted it all. Here’s a story idea for the next time weather keeps you inside.

<!--excerpt-->

-------------------------------

The descendants that the genealogist tracks down and interviews are hesitant to talk about it. What painful secrets are the families keeping? What caused them to move? Can the genealogist piece together the truth?
