title: Writing Prompts 14
---

It's been thoroughly blessed the past couple of weeks. But with those blessings came a major increase in my workload. It's Friday evening. My brain is mush. So no witty intro for this month's prompts I'm afraid. Enjoy!

<!--excerpt-->

1. Write a story about a plague doctor.

2. It's time for the annual poker championship tournament. Yet for one of the contenders, this tournament is more than a game. How so?

3. A monarch wants to divide their kingdom among their children. Who gets what piece, however, will be decided by a competition. What game or sport does the monarch choose? How do the heirs scheme to gain advantage over their siblings?

4. The dice giveth, and the dice taketh away. Write a story where that phrase is taken literally.

5. Try your hand at writing a murder mystery. The scene of the crime -- the United Nations (or a similar gathering of foreign dignitaries).

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
