---

I know it's early, but Happy Christmas in July to my friends down under. And in the spirit of Christmas, here's a present for all of you.

<!--excerpt-->

------------------------------------

The protagonist answers a distress call coming from a spaceship orbiting an unexplored planet. Upon arrival, protagonist finds the ship abandoned, but with the exception of a depleted power supply, there are no signs of distress. Apparently, the whole crew vanished without a trace. As their investigation continues, the protagonist grows more and more uneasy. Maybe it’s that strange hum that seems to be everywhere.
