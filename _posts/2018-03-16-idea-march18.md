title: Idea You Can Steal 3 -- The Box
---

Top o' the mornin' to ye, friends. (Or afternoon, or evening, or...) Happy St. Patrick's Day! There may not be a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, but there is a story idea.

<!--excerpt-->

-------------------------------------------

A child in a desperate situation finds a large, silver box in a shed. The box hums with energy, and the child senses a presence inside the box that doesn't want to be touched. Strange things happen which lead the child to believe that this box (or the presence associated with it) is protecting them. Grateful, the child protects the box from adults who want to destroy it.
