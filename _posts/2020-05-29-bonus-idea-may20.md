title: Idea You Can Steal 38 -- The Possessed Amulet
---

May has an extra Friday this year, so here's an extra story idea for you.

<!--excerpt-->

-------------------------------

The de facto state religion gives out stone amulets to its followers that are said to siphon away their nightmares, bad stress, and emotional pain. The main character, a sensitive soul, believes in their power because they've felt it work for themselves. Gradually, however, they start to have nightmares that the amulet won't alleviate. They also can't shake the feeling that the amulet is crying out for help, like its possessed by a spirit. Where exactly do these amulets come from? How are they made? What horrible religious secrets will the main character unravel?
