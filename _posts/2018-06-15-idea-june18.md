Happy Father's Day to all the dads out there. Here is June's free story idea.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------------------

An old mage and a young warrior meet on the road. Both have been broken by the new empire. Both have lost everything dear to them and desire vengeance. The mage knows that the emperor’s amulet is the root of his magical influence over the land. The warrior knows where this amulet is hidden. So the two become allies and hatch a plan to steal and/or destroy the emperor’s amulet.
