No one goes near the gray house on Oak Hill. The neighbors make sure of that. They keep constant watch, looking out for looters, nosy bureaucrats, and meddlesome teens. Some say they heard gunshots ring out in the yard in the dead of night. What compels these people to guard this house years after it's been abandoned?
