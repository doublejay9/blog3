title: Idea You Can Steal 10 -- The Moon's Champion
---

August has one more Friday left, so here's a bonus story idea for you.

<!--excerpt-->

------------------------------------

The Spirit of the Banished Moon appears to a sun-worshipping people and anoints the town misfit as their champion. Since this Moon Spirit is regarded as an evil deity, the misfit is immediately ostracized (like they weren’t already). When the misfit meets the Moon Spirit next, they discover that the Moon Spirit isn’t evil after all. There is a far greater evil already at work in this world – one that the Moon and their new champion will defeat. What this Bigger Bad is up to you. Yet on their way home, the misfit sees the first sign of the Bigger Bad’s infection – strings of bioluminescent moss hanging from a dead tree.
