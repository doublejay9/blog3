title: Reflections 2021... Maybe [News & Announcement]
---

Hey everyone.

Long-time readers will be confused by the title of this post. I normally write a Reflections letter in December where I look back on the past year and give updates on plans for the coming year. But 2021 has been a very reflective year for me as a whole: personally, professionally, and creatively.

<!--excerpt-->

It's also been a very active year for my muse. I'm steadily working on *Reclaiming the City* and another novel. Let's give it the code name *Iron* for this post. So far this year, I've also sketched out plans for eight more novels (including a prequel to *Reclaiming the City*), two novellas, a short story, and a set of stories that I haven't figured out how long they'll be yet.

Writing about writing is not something my brain is motivated to do right now. I have two posts in the works -- one on writing mysteries and a character analysis. I had planned to release both this year, but my muse appears to have other ideas. I still intend to complete and publish them, but I can't say when that will be anymore.

For now, I need to focus on work, *Reclaiming the City*, *Iron*, and all of the other offline projects I have lined up. That's why **craft-related posts are going on hiatus for the remainder of 2021.** Everything that I'd normally file under the "writing about writing" category counts.

Fear not. Writing prompts and Ideas to Steal will continue for the rest of the year. You can also expect parts of *Reclaiming the City* at the regularly scheduled time. All that's changing is that I'll be taking a week off every month to catch up on my paid work and creative projects that aren't ready for their public debut. I would like to write a normal Reflections letter in December to update everyone, but in case that doesn't happen, I suppose this letter will count.
