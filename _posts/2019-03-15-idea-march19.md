title: Idea You Can Steal 18 -- Desertion
---

An early Happy St. Patrick's Day to you all. Here's another story idea from the Apprentice Wordsmith pot.

<!--excerpt-->

---------------------------------

A young warrior barely survives a battle with the northern tribes and gets lost in the snowy forest. The warrior is rescued and nursed back to health by an odd mystic who lives alone in these woods. Though grateful for the mystic’s kindness, the warrior knows they must return to their regiment. “Strange. Your armor doesn’t suit you,” the mystic says. The youth didn’t choose the path of a warrior; they were drafted into the army. The mystic tempts the youth to desert and join them in a search for “a deeper truth” behind the wars between their peoples. What finally persuades the youth to join the mystic?
