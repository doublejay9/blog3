They must know by now. They’ll come for us. Someone will find us. Someone will break in.

<!--excerpt-->

This is the end, isn’t it? We’ll be blamed for it all, you know. The very minute we locked ourselves in here we sealed our fate. They will remember us as traitors, as selfish. Selfish for admitting that we can’t fix anything – that we can’t work miracles. But we can never convince them. They won’t listen.

Do you think there is any hope for us? That we’ll survive and see beyond this mess. To be honest, I doubt anyone will.

Still, I’m glad you’re with me. I’m glad that I don’t have to face death alone.
