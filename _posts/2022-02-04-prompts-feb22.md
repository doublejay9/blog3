title: Writing Prompts 50

People say that life is like a box of chocolates. They might say the same about my writing prompts. Even I don't know what they'll be before putting together this post. Mainly because I create them in batches and randomly select five from the list every month.

But enough behind-the-scenes jibber-jabber. Here's a box of treats for your imagination.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Write a heist story. The thieves' target? A weapons cache.

2. A spy's mission took a turn for the worse, and now they find themselves in a sticky situation. They seek help from the outside. Where and how do they find an ally?

3. The main character has fallen on hard financial times. Why are they at fault for their situation? How do they change their fortune?

4. A warrior has been appointed as their lord's champion who will fight for their lord in an upcoming duel. Why does the warrior dread this duel?

5. Write about a merchant you *never* haggle with. What happens to the poor fools who try to?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
