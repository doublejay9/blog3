It's back to old routines, and a new season is around the corner. Here are five prompts to kickstart your fall (or spring) writing.

<!--excerpt-->

1. A ship veers way off-course into uncharted waters. With supplies running low, how does the crew survive?

2. You know the phrase "don't blame the messenger"? What happens when someone does blame the messenger? What bad news was the messenger tasked with delivering? Did the messenger even know that the news was bad? How does the messenger suffer?

3. A dying relative reveals a long-held secret to the main character. What is it? How does it change the family forever?

4. Write your take on The Prince and the Pauper plot. Have a wealthy character and a poor character trade places. What does the experience teach both of them?

5. A circus is shutting down. What will happen to the performers? What will happen to the exotic animals?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
