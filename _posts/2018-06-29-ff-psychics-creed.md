Brothers, sisters, we have discovered a great gift. To speak mind to mind. To walk in each other’s dreams. All beyond the reach of our mechanical lords.

<!--excerpt-->

They have intimidated us, imprisoned us, tortured us, tried to make us believe we are insane. They want us to remain blind, fleshy cohorts like the rest of our kind. Yet we all know, we do not want to close our eyes.

Already, the cardboard barriers between us are crumbling. The great age of machines resembles a house of cards. We are beginning to understand what it means to be human. Something our ancestors knew but has been blurred.

I will not tell you that the machines will soon meet their demise. I will not give you false hope of victory. Our numbers are too small. These abilities still too strange. But we have the means to resist. So long as we live, we shall.
