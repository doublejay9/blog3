title: Idea You Can Steal 58 -- A Not-So-Simple Robbery
---

No clever intro this week, y'all. Too much on my mind. Trying to figure out how to get it all done. Plus, my muse isn't being very helpful. Anyway, here's an idea for your muse to chew on.

At first glance, the case presented before the local magistrate appears to be a textbook highway robbery. Yet both victim and suspect tell interesting tales at the hearing. One paints a picture of vengeance. The other speaks of desperate survival. Both stories imply that larger societal forces are at work in this case. What are these larger societal forces? What really happened on the highway that night? How will the magistrate rule?
