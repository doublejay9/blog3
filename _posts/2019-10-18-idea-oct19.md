title: Idea You Can Steal 28 -- The Street Rat and the Dark God
---

Anybody else having a weird week? Not especially busy. Not particularly stressful. Just everything feeling off-kilter. Only me? Okay. And since I can't think of a better segue this Friday evening, here's your story idea for October.

<!--excerpt-->

---------------------------------

A young street urchin catches the eye of a secretive cult. Members approach the youth, tell them of the cult’s dark god, and how the youth is prophesied to become this god’s avatar. The cynical youth doesn’t believe a word and tells the cultists to buzz off. Thus, the cult is forced to kidnap the youth and take them by force to their place of worship. Apparently, the apotheosis ritual requires the youth’s death. How does our young protagonist escape?
