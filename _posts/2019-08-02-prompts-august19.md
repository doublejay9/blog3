title: Writing Prompts 20
---

Traveled recently? I'll be taking a trip to Montreal later this month. So August's Idea to Steal will be coming earlier than scheduled.

With that announcement out of the way, time for writing prompts.

<!--excerpt-->

1. On the national government's orders, all roads leading into and out of a town are sealed off. None of the inhabitants are told why. Yet clues start appearing in the town a day or so later. What are these clues? What picture do they paint?

2. Write a story that takes place during a gymnastics competition.

3. Virtual reality gaming is a popular pasttime. There's a virus on the loose that's able to trap players in an inescapable simulation. Can it be contained? What happens to the people who became its prey?

4. Write a story set in an abandoned mansion.

5. A neat freak's habitual cleaning gets them in trouble. How?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
