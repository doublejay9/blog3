title: Idea You Can Steal 41 -- Lost Identity
---

It's the final day of July, so here's one more idea to kickstart your writing into August.

<!--excerpt-->

-----------------------------

The main character wants to legally change their name, but in order to do so, the local government needs to verify their identity first by cross-referencing official documents (birth certificate, driver’s license, school records, etc) under their old name. The problem is that the government workers can’t find the main character’s files. The only ones that they can pull up are for people with the same name but with drastically different ages, races, genders, spellings, etc. What happened to the main character’s files? Do they not legally exist anymore? What frustrations and drama ensue out of what should have been a straightforward process?
