title: Idea You Can Steal 42 -- The Healing Ritual
---

So I've had an interesting week. My mom's old injury decided to flare up, requiring a visit to the emergency room. That led to me helping my sister move into her college dorm, which wasn't part of our original plan. Thus why this post is late.

But enough about me. Here's your Idea to Steal for August.

<!--excerpt-->

----------------------------------------

A village youth is abducted and poisoned by a strange, secret cult. The youth quickly learns that they will be participating in one of the cult's upcoming rites. The twist is that the youth won't be a human sacrifice. Rather, they will be ritually cured of the illness that's now taking hold of them. How do different cult members treat the ailing youth on their pilgrimage to the ritual site? Why hasn't the youth's village come to their rescue? Why can't the youth shake the feeling that they've met some of these cultists before?
