Anyone else have the feeling that something is coming? No, not these writing prompts for August. I mean something massive and world-changing.

Just me? Okay. Anyway, here's some more writing prompts to help keep your summer writing streak going.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Write a story about a family planning a funeral. Bonus points if the main characters aren't adult children planning a funeral for their recently deceased parent.

2. Write about rival doctors competiting for the same promotion at the hospital where they work.

3. Write about the espionage and diplomatic trickery being played between a country's ruler, a foreign ambassador, and a double agent.

4. A group of prototype war robots malfunction and start attacking a city. How do their human creators try to stop them? Have the robots just initiated a war? Or can peace be salvaged?

5. One look at our main character and people would mistake them for an ordinary courier. But the main character doesn't deliver packages. They deliver recovered memories.

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
