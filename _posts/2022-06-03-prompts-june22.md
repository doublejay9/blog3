We had a pop-up thunderstorm roll through last night. That's the surest sign in these parts that summer has arrived. Here's some writing prompts to help you weather the next bout of summer (or winter) weather.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Write about a soldier's journey home from war.

2. The main character is secretly jealous of someone. Why? Who is the mutual acquaintance that ultimately betrays this secret?

3. Write a story centered on a main character and their pet. Bonus points if the pet isn't a cat or a dog.

4. The main character has been the butt of rumors for weeks. Now their enemies have come to collect a debt that the main character does not owe. How can the main character clear up the misunderstanding and convince these people to leave them alone?

5. A spirit is forced to possess a human for its own safety. Write about the alliance (or even friendship) that forms between spirit and host. Is there a way for the human to help the spirit eliminate whatever is threatening it?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
