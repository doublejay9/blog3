title: Writing Prompts 46
---

It's the first of October. You know what that means. Time to start spooky month off right with a new batch of writing prompts.

<!--excerpt-->

1. Our main characters wish to confront a greedy merchant. What kind of trap do they build for the merchant? What will they use as bait?

2.  Write a story that begins with an ally's funeral.

3.  Write about a secret raid our main characters launch on an enemy lair. For bonus points and extra mileage, write a similar scene from the enemies' perspective as they discover the intrusion and defend their base.

4.  Write about how your main character loses their entire fortune in a single night.

5.  The main character is a celebrity who has just been (very publicly) canceled. What must they do to secure a living? How will they try to restore their good name?

**If you use any of these prompts, please share your story or a link to your story in the comments below.**
