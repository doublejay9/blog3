-----------------------

There's a rare resource that the authorities will protect at all costs -- an oil well, a vein of super-conductive metal, a spring of magical water. The territory only has one source for this powerful material, and the location is known only by a select few guardians. However, the guardians betray the secret location to a rebel group. Why? How will this rare material aid the rebel's cause? How do the authorities react when they see the rebels wielding the same power they do?
