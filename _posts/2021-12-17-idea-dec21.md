title: Idea You Can Steal 60 -- The Great Christmas Light Fight
---

My family is hosting Christmas this year too. Thus, my last two posts of 2021 may not land on Fridays. It really depends on when guests arrive and when I can scrape together a few minutes to update the blog. For now, though, here's a story idea to feed your next writing session.

<!--excerpt-->

----------------------------------

What started as a compliant over Christmas lights has spiraled into a community-wide conflict that threatens to rip it in two. Write from the perspective of the last remaining neutral person in the neighborhood. Why are they neutral in spite of all the peer pressure to choose a side? Will they try to resolve the conflict? Will they call out both sides for their pettiness?
