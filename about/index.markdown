title: About Me

Hello all. I'm Joyce Lewis, though some of you may know me better as doublejay9. I spent my childhood moving around every 3 years, but now my family and I have settled in Northern Virginia.

I was that quiet kid who was perfectly content playing with stuffed animals by herself, creating stories for hours. When I was 12, in a moment of severe boredom, I started writing these stories down. I haven't stopped. My friends in high school introduced me to fantasy and science fiction, and I quickly became addicted. Today, these are the two genres I primarily write in.

Thanks for stopping by the blog. I hope you find something interesting or useful here. Come back for more -- I've got a lot of cool plans. Until then, see you around the internet.
